    - **Action:**  
      **He holds two plasma knives** — glowing blue with slight yellow undertones — that **emit magical flames and sparks**. His posture is powerful and professional, posing for a photo shoot, **approaching the audience with a threatening yet composed demeanor while holding the knives**.
