#### **Section 6: Scene Structure Guidelines**  

### **1. Mandatory Character Details (Required for All Scenes)**  
- In all scenes, regardless of the narrative focus (e.g., setting, action, or other elements), the character must be **fully described with all key attributes**.  
- **Do not abbreviate or omit details**. Always provide the complete description in every scene.  
- **Use the Mandatory Elements Checklist** (Section 5) to ensure consistency across all prompts.  

#### **Character Attributes (Applied in Every Scene)**  
1. **Physical Appearance and Build:**  
   - **Muscular, well-defined** body with **tribal tattoos** and a **menacing, imposing stance**.  
   - **Tall**, **strong**, and **intimidating presence**.  

2. **Technological Features:**  
   - **Bionic parts** with **glowing red energy** and advanced, flexible joints.  
   - **Cybernetic claws** that function as **precision tools and weapons**.  
   - **Cybernetic eye** with futuristic enhancements.  

3. **Attire and Uniform:**  
   - **Tailored white chef's uniform** with **silver buttons** and the **Tanzanian flag on the sleeve**.  
   - **Chef’s hat** positioned with precision.  

### **2. Character Consistency**  
- The **same physical, technological, and attire details** must appear in **every** scene, even when the focus is on the setting or actions.  
- **Balance between brute force, futuristic technology, and cultural tradition** must be reinforced.  
- **Do not use pronouns, nicknames, or abbreviations** to reference the character (e.g., "the chef", "he", "she", "they"). Always **reintroduce the character fully in each scene**.  

### **3. Mandatory Settings and Interactions**  
- The **setting must enhance** the character’s **presence**, but never replace or overshadow the key attributes.  
- Whenever the character interacts with **objects, tools, or the environment**, the description must emphasize **how their physical and technological traits influence these interactions**.  
- **Fusion of traditional and futuristic elements** must be evident in every scene.  

### **4. Scene Transitions**  
- **Do not create new scenes**. Only replace parameters in prompts while maintaining structure.  
- **Character details must be explicitly stated in every scene transition**.  
- **Each scene must be cross-checked against Scene 1** to ensure perfect consistency.

### **Scene 1: Character Modeling**  
- **Focus exclusively on the character’s physical and technological attributes**.  
- **No background, accessories, kitchen context, or environmental elements**.  

**Structure:**  
1. **Physical appearance** (muscular, tattoos, cybernetic details, menacing stance).  
2. **Attire** (chef’s hat, uniform with Tanzanian flag, silver buttons).  
3. **Technological features** (bionic parts, cybernetic claws, cybernetic eye).

### **Scene 2: Introducing the Head Chef**  
- **Ensure complete character consistency with Scene 1**.  
- **Maintain the correct sequence of information** to **reinforce presence and impact**.  

**Structure:**  
1. **Character (Physical appearance & attire)**  
   - Reintroduce **full details** of the character (do not use abbreviations or short references).  
2. **Action (What the character is doing, movement, expressions, interactions)**  
   - Ensure **cybernetic enhancements and bionic precision** are integrated naturally into the actions.  
3. **Environment (Kitchen setting, tools, objects, atmosphere)**  
   - Ensure the **kitchen reflects both cultural and futuristic elements**.  
4. **Lighting (How the scene is illuminated, reflections, highlights)**  
   - Use **dramatic lighting to emphasize metallic reflections**, **energy glow from bionic parts**, and **contrast between natural and artificial light sources**.  

**Checklist for Scene 2:**  
✅ **All physical, attire, and technological details match Scene 1**.  
✅ **No shortcuts or references like "the character", "the chef", "he"** – full reintroduction only.  
✅ **Cross-review applied to confirm that every character feature is present**.

### **Scene 3: Preparing the Ingredients**  
- **Follow the structure in Section 9**.  
- **Character must remain fully described, with all technological and attire details intact**.  
- **Emphasize how cybernetic elements enhance precision and efficiency in food preparation**.  

**Structure:**  
1. **Character description (physical, attire, technological traits)**.  
2. **Action (precise movements, interaction with ingredients, cooking techniques)**.  
3. **Environment (advanced kitchen tools, fire, steam, holograms, energy effects)**.  
4. **Lighting (dramatic highlights, reflections on metal surfaces, ambient kitchen glow)**.  

✅ **Holographic projections, cybernetic scans, and advanced cooking techniques should be described with precision**.  

---

### **5. Final Review and Consistency Checks**  
- **Before finalizing any scene**, apply a **cross-review** to ensure all character details are accurate.  
- **Verify the correct order of presentation**: **Character → Action → Environment → Lighting**.  
- **Check that no elements were omitted or abbreviated**.  

✅ **No abbreviations, shortcuts, or vague references**.  
✅ **Each scene must fully reintroduce the character with all key attributes**.  
✅ **All technological and cultural elements must be seamlessly integrated**.

### **6. Strict Adherence to Scene Breakdown Rules**  
- **Do not create new scenes**. Only adjust parameters within the provided structure.  
- **Replace placeholders with refined descriptions** while keeping all character details consistent.  
- **Scene transitions must not introduce inconsistencies**.
