   - Whenever the character interacts with objects or the environment (e.g., plasma knives, utensils, pots, stoves, knives, cutlery, precision, fire, ingredients, or holograms), the description should emphasize how their physical and technological traits influence these interactions.

- **Scene Transitions:**
   - Replacing Parameters in Prompts.
   - Reintroduce the character with the same details as Scene 1.
   - When transitioning between scenes, make sure that **character details, Traits are coherent and conveyed**.
